*Typus configuration files (November 18th, 2008)*

Typus configuration files are now located under the `config/typus` 
folder. This will make the files easier to mantain when you have 
an application with a lot of controllers.

After the feedback I got at the "Conferencia Rails '08" I wont talk 
anymore about typus plugins as it's a little confising. The generator 
for the plugins is also removed.

*Redefinition of roles (November 3rd, 2008)*

Previously roles only allowed to defined permissions for the CRUD 
actions. From 2008/11/03 you can define any action on the roles. 
The afected file is `config/typus_roles.yml`.

Before

    admin:
      TypusUser: crud
      Newsletter: crud

After

    admin:
      TypusUser: create, read, update, delete
      Newsletter: create, read, update, delete, generate, preview, deliver

*Redefinition of actions (October 31st, 2008)*

This will allow us to define actions per action. Code is now cleaner 
and easier to read.

      actions:
