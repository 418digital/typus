== Introduction ==

A few years ago I developed websites using http://movabletype.org/[Movable Type], 
http://drupal.com/[Drupal], http://textpattern.com/[TextPattern] and 
http://b2evolution.net/[b2], which later became http://wordpress.org/[Wordpress]. 
I decided to stop using all those content management systems and 
started to develop web applications with http://rubyonrails.org/[Ruby on Rails].

Inspired by the tools I used, and with a simple idea "Trusted users 
editing structured content", I started to develop a 
http://rubyonrails.org/[Rails] application to manage the sites I was 
building. This was the first attempt to make a simple but powerful 
content management system. I adapted that application to many 
projects, but I decided to extract the core functionality as a plugin 
which is now known a **Typus**.

On December 2007, **Typus** was released under a xref:mit-license[MIT License].
