# Credits

Somehow involved in the project:

* [Yukihiro "matz" Matsumoto][1] creator of [Ruby][2], in my opinion, the most
beautiful programming language.
* [David Heinemeier Hansson][3] for creating [Ruby on Rails][4].
* [Django Admin][5] who inspired part of the  development, in special the
templates rendering and user interface.

You can see a list of contributors and their commits on [GitHub][6].
