**Typus** is a control panel for [Ruby on Rails][1] applications to allow
trusted users edit structured content.

Itâ€™s not a CMS with a full working system but it provides a part of the
system: authentication, permissions and basic look and feel for your
websites control panel. So using [Rails][1] with **Typus** lets you
concentrate on your application instead of the bits to manage the system.

**Typus** is the "old latin" word for **type** which stands for:

> A category of people or things having common characteristics.

You can try a demo [here][2].

## Key Features

* Integrated authentication with Access Control Lists.
* CRUD and custom actions for your models on a clean interface.
* Internationalized interface.
* Overridable and extensible templates.

* Tested with **SQLite3**, **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.
* **MIT License**, the same as [Rails][1].
