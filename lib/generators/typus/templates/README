= Customizing Typus

You can overwrite and extend Admin::MasterController with your methods.

Actions have to be defined in <tt>config/typus/application.yml</tt>:

    Post:
      actions:
        index: custom_action
        edit: custom_action_for_an_item

Remember you need to add permissions on <tt>config/typus/application_roles.yml</tt> 
to have access to the new actions.

    admin:
      Post: all # Which is a shorcut for having access to all actions.

    editor:
      Post: create, read, update, custom_action_for_an_item

Your controller will look like this ...

    class Admin::PostsController < Admin::MasterController

      def custom_action
        ...
      end

      def custom_action_for_an_item
        ...
      end

    end
